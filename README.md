### 1.4 Bussnies Objective and Constraint
<pre>Data is provided by kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercari-price-suggestion challenge,to predict the price of a given product.This problem is regression problem(Supervised Learning).The features we have in train data train_id,name,item_condition_id,category_name,brand_name,shipping, item-description,price in test data except price feature which is our target feature.The feature contain categorical,Numerical and Text.
<li> The target is to solve the problem suggest the resonable price of products.</li>
<li> No strict latency constraints,because the problem demand to suggest a highly.</li> </pre>
